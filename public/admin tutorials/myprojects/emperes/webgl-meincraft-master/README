   -- WebGL Meincraft

   A blatant minecraft clone.  Actually it's not even that, it's just
   a voxel thingy WebGL engine that displays blocks in a minecraft style.

   Currently the terrain.png in this repository is from some minecraft
   texture set and a license violation.  Please don't sue me.

   Code itself is BSD licensed, see LICENSE for more details.

   What else?  The gl-matrix library was extended for vec4 support.
   Stock won't work.
