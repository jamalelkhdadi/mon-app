                <h2>What is Cookie</h2>
                <p>A cookie is a small file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a
                    web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the
                    server each time the browser requests a page from the server. Cookies can be used by web servers to
                    identity and track users as they navigate different pages on a website and identify users returning
                    to a website. Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user,
                    but personal information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and
                    obtained from cookies.</p>

                <p>If you use the Tutorials Point, both Tutorials Point and third parties will use cookies to track and
                    monitor some of your activities on and off the Tutorials Point website, and store and access some
                    data about you, your browsing history, and your usage of the tutorialspoint.com website.</p>
                <p>We use both session cookies, which expire after a short time or when you close your browser, and
                    persistent cookies, which remain stored in your browser for a set period of time. We use session
                    cookies to identify you during a single browsing session, like when you log into Tutorials Point. We
                    use persistent cookies where we need to identify you over a longer period, like when you request
                    that we keep you signed in.</p>

                <p>This policy describes how both Tutorials Point and other third parties use cookies both within and
                    without the Tutorials Point Website and how you can exercise a greater degree of control over
                    cookies. Please keep in mind that this may alter your experience with our platform, and may limit
                    certain features (including being logged in as a user).</p>
