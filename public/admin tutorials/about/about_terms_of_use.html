                </p>
                <h2>Revenue Sharing and Payments</h2>
                <p>When an instructor or a publisher hosts a course or an eBook on our website and we sell that course
                    or eBook to our students, the revenue generated by the paid courses will have 45% revenue share for
                    the company and the remaining 55% revenue will be shared with the instructor or the publisher.</p>
                <p>If a student purchases a course or an eBook in India, then it requires us to remit sales taxes, good
                    and service tax (GST), or other similar transaction taxes ("Transaction Taxes"), under applicable
                    law, we will collect and remit those Transaction Taxes to the competent tax authorities for those
                    sales. If the student purchases the course from outside India through Paypal, GST is not applicable,
                    but paypal gateway charges would be applicable.</p>
                <p>When a student purchases a course, we calculate the gross amount of the sale as the amount actually
                    received by Tutorials Point from the student ("Sale Amount"). From this, the applicable taxes and
                    payment gateway transaction charges are deducted to calculate the net amount of the sale ("Net
                    Amount").</p>
                <p>Your revenue share will be 55% of the Net Amount. Tutor or Publisher residing in India will have to
                    furnish PAN card details for TDS deduction of 10% as per government norms. For Tutor or Publisher
                    based outside India, TDS will not be deducted from your revenue share.</p>
                <p>We process the payments in the first week of every month. Any sell becomes mature after its 30 days
                    guarantee period is over. Once a sell is matured, we credit the payments of that sell in the first
                    week of the subsequent month. We reserve the right not to pay out funds in the event of identified
                    fraud, violations of intellectual property rights, or other violations of the law.</p>
                <p>We have the following two methods to remit your payments based on your locality:</p>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>
                        <p>If you are an instructor/publisher residing in India, we remit your payments directly in your
                            bank account through online bank transaction. To process your payments, we will require your
                            bank account details such as account number, account holder’s name, bank name, branch name,
                            and IFSC code.</p>

                    <li>

                            (USD), through PayPal, regardless of the currency with which the sale was made. You must own
                            a PayPal account and keep us informed of the correct email associated with your account, in
